## I found a bug!

Please report bugs as an issue or in an email. Include the information that is
relevant and necessary for reproducing the bug.

If it is possible, try to make a minimal example that causes the bug. If you
need help with that, we will happily help you out, so don't hesitate to file an
"imperfect" bug report.

### Documentation

We consider inconsistent or lacking documentation a bug!

## I want to suggest an improvement

Suggestions for improvements to the project are very welcome. Please open an
issue or send an email.

We are very grateful to the many users who have shared their papercuts. This
has led to numerous quality of life improvements. Thanks!

## Feature requests

Feature requests may require more involved work to implement. Therefore,
considering feature requests requires clear communication about who needs it
and for what purpose. In order to meet such a request, we need to have a
conversation about what is valued and expected.

To start a conversation about a feature request, please send an email or open
an issue.

If we believe the feature would be a good step for _bentopy_, we will move to a
design discussion about how we can best implement it to meet the requirements.
_We will also discuss who can best contribute the change._

### Authorship/contributorship

To ensure long-term maintainability and consistency with our values, the
maintainers usually handle the implementation of large or complex changes.

Unless noted otherwise, when the person who files a request is invited to
propose the change through a pull request, their work is considered a small
contribution and they will be acknowledged in the project description.

## I want to open a pull request

Please wait with filing a pull request until we invite you. At that stage, we
will have had a design discussion and a conversation about the requirements.
Based on that, we can review the change in a meaningful and efficient way.

## Authors

## Values

We value transparency, accountability, and respect for users, contributors, and
maintainers. We hold our work to high standards.

These values are shared by _bentopy_ authors and contributors.
